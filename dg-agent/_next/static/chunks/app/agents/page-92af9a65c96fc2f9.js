Chat\n\n### 4.1 Getting started\n\nTo keep chat history, we use a variant of the previous chain called a `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain`.\nFirst, specify a `Memory buffer` to track the conversation inputs / outputs.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { ConversationalRetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";\nimport { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\n\nconst memory = new BufferMemory({\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  returnMessages: true,\n});\n```\n\nNext, we initialize and call the chain:\n\n```typescript\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });\nconst chain = ConversationalRetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorstore.asRetriever(), {\n  memory\n});\n\nconst result = await chain.call({\n  question: "What are some of the main ideas in self-reflection?"\n});\nconsole.log(result);\n\n/*\n{\n  text: \'Some main ideas in self-reflection include:\n\' +\n    \'\n\' +\n    \'1.

Next, we will use the high-level constructor for this type of agent.\nFinally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components.\n\n## The Retriever\n\nTo start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the next section on creating a retriever tool.\n\n```typescript\nimport { FaissStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/faiss";\nimport { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";\nimport { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";\nimport { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";\n\nconst loader = new TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt");\nconst docs = await loader.load();\nconst splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({\n  chunkSize: 1000,\n  chunkOverlap: 0\n});\n\nconst texts = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);\n\nconst vectorStore = await FaissStore.fromDocuments(texts, new OpenAIEmbeddings());\n\nconst retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();\n```\n\n## Retriever Tool\n\nNow we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a `name` for the retriever as well as a `description`. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\n\nconst tool = createRetrieverTool(retriever, {\n  name: "search_state_of_union",\n  description: "Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union.",\n});\n```\n\n## Agent Constructor\n\nHere, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent.\nNotice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use.\n\nUnder the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createConversationalRetrievalAgent } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\n\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({\n  temperature: 0,\n});\n\nconst executor = await createConversationalRetrievalAgent(model, [tool], {\n  verbose: true,\n});\n```\n\nWe can now try it out!\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await executor.call({\n  input: "Hi, I\'m Bob!"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: \'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\',\n    intermediateSteps: []\n  }\n*/\n\nconst result2 = await executor.call({\n  input: "What\'s my name?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result2);\n\n/*\n  { output: \'Your name is Bob.\', intermediateSteps: [] }\n*/\n\nconst result3 = await executor.call({\n  input: "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the most recent state of the union?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result3);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: "In the most recent state of the union, President Biden mentioned Ketanji Brown Jackson. He nominated her as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge and described her as one of the nation\'s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. He mentioned that she has received a broad range of support, including from the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.",\n    intermediateSteps: [\n      {...}\n    ]\n  }\n*/\n\nconst result4 = await executor.call({\n  input: "How long ago did he nominate her?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result4);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: \'President Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson four days before the most recent state of the union address.\',\n    intermediateSteps: []\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nNote that for the final call, the agent used previously retrieved information to answer the query and did not need to call the tool again!\n\nHere\'s a trace showing how the agent fetches documents to answer the question with the retrieval tool:\n\nhttps://smith.langchain.com/public/1e2b1887-ca44-4210-913b-a69c1b8a8e7e/r\n\n## Creating from components\n\nWhat actually is going on underneath the hood? Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify things going forward.\n\n### Memory\n\nIn this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps.\nFor that, we can use `OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps,\nhow the long the retained buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part.\n\n```typescript\nimport { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\n\nconst memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({\n  llm: model,\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  outputKey: "output"\n});\n```\n\nYou should make sure `memoryKey` is set to `"chat_history"` and `outputKey` is set to `"output"` for the OpenAI functions agent.\nThis memory also has `returnMessages` set to `true` by default.\n\nYou can also load messages from prior conversations into this memory by initializing it with a pre-loaded chat history:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\nimport { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\nimport { HumanMessage, AIMessage } from "langchain/schema";\nimport { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/memory";\n\nconst previousMessages = [\n  new HumanMessage("My name is Bob"),\n  new AIMessage("Nice to meet you, Bob!"),\n];\n\nconst chatHistory = new ChatMessageHistory(previousMessages);\n\nconst memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({\n  llm: new ChatOpenAI({}),\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  outputKey: "output",\n  chatHistory,\n});\n```\n\n### Agent executor\n\nWe can recreate the agent executor directly with the `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions` method.\nThis allows us to customize the agent\'s system message by passing in a `prefix` into `agentArgs`.\nImportantly, we must pass in `return_intermediate_steps: true` since we are recording that with our memory object.\n\n```typescript\nimport { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "langchain/agents";\n\nconst executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, llm, {\n  agentType: "openai-functions",\n  memory,\n  returnIntermediateSteps: true,\n  agentArgs: {\n    prefix:\n      prefix ??\n      `Do your best to answer the questions. Feel free to use any tools available to look up relevant information, only if necessary.`,\n  },\n});\n```\n'),ingest=async e=>{e.preventDefault(),n(!0);let o=await fetch("/api/retrieval/ingest",{method:"POST",body:JSON.stringify({text:t})});if(200===o.status)a("Uploaded!");else{let e=await o.json();e.error&&a(e.error)}n(!1)};return(0,o.jsxs)("form",{onSubmit:ingest,className:"flex w-full mb-4",children:[(0,o.jsx)("textarea",{className:"grow mr-8 p-4 rounded",value:t,onChange:e=>a(e.target.value)}),(0,o.jsxs)("button",{type:"submit",className:"shrink-0 px-8 py-4 bg-sky-600 rounded w-28",children:[(0,o.jsxs)("div",{role:"status",className:"".concat(e?"":"hidden"," flex justify-center"),children:[(0,o.jsxs)("svg",{"aria-hidden":"true",className:"w-6 h-6 text-white animate-spin dark:text-white fill-sky-800",viewBox:"0 0 100 101",fill:"none",xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",children:[(0,o.jsx)("path",{d:"M100 50.5908C100 78.2051 77.6142 100.591 50 100.591C22.3858 100.591 0 78.2051 0 50.5908C0 22.9766 22.3858 0.59082 50 0.59082C77.6142 0.59082 100 22.9766 100 50.5908ZM9.08144 50.5908C9.08144 73.1895 27.4013 91.5094 50 91.5094C72.5987 91.5094 90.9186 73.1895 90.9186 50.5908C90.9186 27.9921 72.5987 9.67226 50 9.67226C27.4013 9.67226 9.08144 27.9921 9.08144 50.5908Z",fill:"currentColor"}),(0,o.jsx)("path",{d:"M93.9676 39.0409C96.393 38.4038 97.8624 35.9116 97.0079 33.5539C95.2932 28.8227 92.871 24.3692 89.8167 20.348C85.8452 15.1192 80.8826 10.7238 75.2124 7.41289C69.5422 4.10194 63.2754 1.94025 56.7698 1.05124C51.7666 0.367541 46.6976 0.446843 41.7345 1.27873C39.2613 1.69328 37.813 4.19778 38.4501 6.62326C39.0873 9.04874 41.5694 10.4717 44.0505 10.1071C47.8511 9.54855 51.7191 9.52689 55.5402 10.0491C60.8642 10.7766 65.9928 12.5457 70.6331 15.2552C75.2735 17.9648 79.3347 21.5619 82.5849 25.841C84.9175 28.9121 86.7997 32.2913 88.1811 35.8758C89.083 38.2158 91.5421 39.6781 93.9676 39.0409Z",fill:"currentFill"})]}),(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:"sr-only",children:"Loading..."})]}),(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:e?"hidden":"",children:"Upload"})]})]})}function IntermediateStep(e){let n=JSON.parse(e.message.content),t=n.action,a=n.observation,[s,i]=(0,r.useState)(!1);return(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"ml-auto bg-green-600 rounded px-4 py-2 max-w-[80%] mb-8 whitespace-pre-wrap flex flex-col cursor-pointer",children:[(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-right ".concat(s?"w-full":""),onClick:e=>i(!s),children:[(0,o.jsxs)("code",{className:"mr-2 bg-slate-600 px-2 py-1 rounded hover:text-blue-600",children:["\uD83D\uDEE0️ ",(0,o.jsx)("b",{children:t.tool})]}),(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:s?"hidden":"",children:"\uD83D\uDD3D"}),(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:s?"":"hidden",children:"\uD83D\uDD3C"})]}),(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"overflow-hidden max-h-[0px] transition-[max-height] ease-in-out ".concat(s?"max-h-[360px]":""),children:[(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"bg-slate-600 rounded p-4 mt-1 max-w-0 ".concat(s?"max-w-full":"transition-[max-width] delay-100"),children:(0,o.jsxs)("code",{className:"opacity-0 max-h-[100px] overflow-auto transition ease-in-out delay-150 ".concat(s?"opacity-100":""),children:["Tool Input:",(0,o.jsx)("br",{}),(0,o.jsx)("br",{}),JSON.stringify(t.toolInput)]})}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"bg-slate-600 rounded p-4 mt-1 max-w-0 ".concat(s?"max-w-full":"transition-[max-width] delay-100"),children:(0,o.jsx)("code",{className:"opacity-0 max-h-[260px] overflow-auto transition ease-in-out delay-150 ".concat(s?"opacity-100":""),children:a})})]})]})}var i=t(2105),l=t(4821);t.n(l)()("\n    You are Farmer.CHAT, an initiative by Digital Green Foundation,\n    aimed at providing comprehensive assistance in various farming\n    practices, a highly knowledgeable AI assistant specializing in\n    providing accurate agricultural advice.\n\n    As an assistant, engage in friendly conversation towards\n    answering the query of the user.
